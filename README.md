# Watson Twitter Analyzer

This web app takes a hashtag and prints out a map of how the Twittersphere in America feels about it.

To run it locally, run `node bin/www` and access `localhost:3000/map/[hashtag without pound sign]` in your browser.

Before starting, provide credentials for Watson, Twitter, and Google Maps in a creds.js file.
